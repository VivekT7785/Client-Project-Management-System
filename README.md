Welcome to the Client-Project Management System! This Django-based application is designed to streamline the management of clients, projects, and users within an organization. It facilitates the registration and management of clients and projects, as well as the assignment of users to various projects. The system is built to handle a large number of users and clients efficiently, providing essential features to maintain and oversee project assignments.
